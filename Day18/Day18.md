## Introduction to React

- **React**: A JavaScript library developed by Facebook, used to build user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React allows developers to break down the UI into reusable components, which makes the code more modular and maintainable.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, enhancing performance by minimizing costly DOM manipulations.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Reactâ€™s data flow is one-way (from parent to child components), making it easier to debug and track changes in the application.
